# debs, gems, rpms and extra_files allow you declare the OS packages,
# gems, and raw files that this barclamp needs.

# debs allows you to declare extra repositories to pull packages from
# and delare that packages that you need for systems that use Debian-style
# packaging.  
debs:
  pkgs:
    - tgt
    - lvm2
    # paramiko needed for SSH-based SAN drivers
    - python-paramiko

# extra_files downloads and saves a file to be slipstreamed on to the 
# crowbar .iso in the extra/files directory (or a subdirectory thereof).
# The build system will try to extract the .rpm files from 
# anything that looks like an Oracle java rpm.bin and treat the extracted
# .rpm files as if they were provided by raw_pkgs.
